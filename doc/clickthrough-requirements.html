<h2>Clickthrough Package Requirements Template</h2>

<h3>I. Introduction</h3>

The following is a requirements document for the Clickthrough package, an ACS service.

<h3>II. Vision Statement</h3><p>

The Clickthrough package provides a service that allows a site or subsite
to monitor how its users exit the site, by recording which links are 
followed to external sites. Any link can be clickthrough-enabled by embedding
special information in its destination address.

<p>

Clickthrough collects information about each pair of local (origin) and foreign (destination) 
addresses, including a daily count of clickthroughs between each such pair of addresses.

<p>

This clickthrough log can be used to provide external sites with a measure
of how much traffic originated from the local site, which can be useful for
auditing or confirming revenue generating clickthroughs (e.g., referrals).

<h3>III. Clickthrough Package Overview</h3>

The Clickthrough package, as a service, has no user interface: in fact, the clickthrough 
functionality is totally transparent to the end user, who simply follows links as if they 
were regular, direct links to external sites. The bulk of the package is composed of 
admin pages that build reports about the collected information.

<p>

The Clickthrough package is subsite aware and can be mounted under any other package
mount point to provide clickthrough logging service for that package (such a package 
becomes the <i>parent package</i>). If site-wide clickthrough logging is desired, 
a Clickthrough instance can be mounted under the site root. Namely, this can be done 
to emulate the functionality and behavior of the legacy clickthrough module, which 
used <code>/ct/</code> as its "mount point".

<p>

The allowed transitions in the Clickthrough package are:

<ul>
  <li>user level:
  <ul>
    <li>recording information about the clickthrough (origin, destination, date, 
        parent package), by incrementing the appropriate click count for each 
	clickthrough-enabled link that the user clicks on;
  </ul>

  <li>Clickthrough administrator level:
  <ul>
    <li>obtaining reports about the collected information, including all clickthroughs
        to and from specific addresses, by date, for each specific parent package.
  </ul>
</ul>

Clickthrough-enabled links to external sites can be embedded in dynamic pages 
(e.g., Tcl, ADP) by using a procedure that automatically wraps a plain link with 
the appropriate clickthrough information.

<p>

Embedding links in static HTML pages, although supported in previous versions, is 
no longer a requirement for this version of Clickthrough. In fact, the embedded link 
would have to contain hardcoded clickthrough information. This has the disadvantage 
of making such a clickthrough-enabled link dependent on the location (the mount point) 
of the Clickthrough instance.

<h3>IV. Use-cases and User-scenarios</h3>

The Clickthrough package is used by three possibly overlapping classes of users:

<ul>
  <li>Developers or designers (collectively referred to as "developers"), who embed 
      clickthrough-enabled links into dynamic pages;
  <li>End-users (referred to simply as "users"), who follow clickthrough-enabled links
      to external sites;
  <li>Clickthrough administrators (referred to "admins"), who use the admin pages to
      obtain information about the clickthroughs from the site to external addresses.
</ul>


<h4>Clickthrough-enabling links</h4>

<b>David Developer</b> wants a link on a page to be clickthrough-enabled. This means that when
the user clicks on the link she will be taken to the external site as soon as possible, and the 
clickthrough will be logged in the background. 

<p>

To clickthrough-enable a link in a dynamic page (e.g., a Tcl or ADP page), David wraps the 
<code>href</code> part of the link as an argument to a procedure that automatically provides 
all the necessary information for the clickthrough to be logged, namely the location of the 
local page (i.e., the origin of the clickthrough), as well as the location of the appropriate 
clickthrough instance in the sitemap. In this case, David does not need to be aware of the 
final location of the page he's writing nor be aware of whether and where the clickthrough instance 
will be mounted on the sitemap, because he does not need to provide any information to the 
procedure other than the destination URL.

<h4>Following clickthrough-enabled links</h4>

<b>Ursula User</b> is browsing the site and follows a clickthrough-enabled link to an external site. 
To Ursula, this link is indistinguishable from a regular link. By clicking on it, Ursula is taken
to the destination page as soon as possible, with only a slight delay. In the background, the 
Clickthrough package has logged this clickthrough, by incrementing the daily click count for this
particular local-URL/foreign-URL/parent-package tuple.


<h4>Obtaining reports about clickthroughs</h4>

<b>Albert Admin</b> wants to know how users are exiting a specific part of the site by following links
to external sites. If a Clickthrough instance has been previously mounted under the package that Albert 
is interested in (meaning that the package has been recording clickthroughs for clickthrough-enabled 
links), he visits the admin pages for that Clickthrough instance and is able to see reports about when and 
how frequently users have left that section by following clickthrough-enabled links to external sites. 
Albert is shown a daily click count for each local page, for each external site and/or for each 
local-URL/foreign-URL pair. Albert can see raw totals or agreggated data (summary reports).

<h3>VI.A Requirements: Data Model</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>10.10.0</b> Clickthrough log
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>10.10.10</b> Each clickthrough log record refers to a unique local-URL/foreign-URL pair 
        and to a parent package instance.
    <li><b>10.10.20</b> No more than one clickthrough log record for each local-URL/foreign-URL pair 
        will exist for any single day.
    <li><b>10.10.30</b> Each clickthrough log record contains an incremental count of the clickthroughs 
        for the local-URL/foreign-URL pair, the package instance and the day it refers to.
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>VI.B Requirements: Developer Support</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>20.10.0</b> Format of clickthrough-enabled links
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>20.10.10</b> A clickthrough-enabled link will have the following format: 
       <code>/<i>parent-package</i>/<i>clickthrough-package</i>/<i>relative-path-of-local-file-under-parent-package</i>?send_to=<i>foreign-url</i></code>, in which 
       <i>parent-package</i> represents the mounting point of the parent package, 
       <i>clickthrough-package</i> represents the mounting point of the Clickthrough 
	  instance underneath the parent package, 
       <i>relative-path-of-local-file-under-parent-package</i> represents the path to the local 
	  file that contains the clickthrough-enabled link, relative to the parent package, and
       <i>foreign-url</i> represents the URL of the external site.

       <p>
       
        As an example, <code>/doc/click/basics/file.html?send_to=http://www.adomain.com/adir/afile.html</code>
	will record clickthroughs from a file named <code>file.html</code>, located under 
	<code>/doc/basics</code> (<code>/doc</code> being the mounting point for the ACS Core Documents
	package and <code>basics</code> being a subdirectory within that package) to the
	<code>http://www.adomain.com/adir/afile.html</code> external page.
  </ul>
  <p>

  <li><b>20.20.0</b> Clickthrough-enabling links
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>20.20.10.0</b> Clickthrough-enabling links in dynamic pages
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>20.20.10.10</b> A developer shall be able to build a clickthrough-enabled
          link in a dynamic page (e.g., Tcl or ADP pages) just by passing the destination, 
	  or foreign, URL to a procedure. This procedure will return the content of 
	  the <code>href</code> attribute of an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag. 
	  Such content will be determined at run-time and will correspond either 
	  to a plain link to the provided URL or to a clickthrough-enabled link 
	  to that same address, depending on whether a Clickthrough package is 
	  mounted under the package to which the page belongs, or not.
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>


<h3>VI.C Requirements: Internal Transactions</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>30.10.0</b> Recording clickthroughs
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>30.10.10</b> Clickthrough logging should use a caching mechanism in order to avoid incurring
        a database hit for every link that is followed.
  </ul>
</ul>


<h3>VI.D Requirements: Administrator Interface</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>40.10.0</b> Raw data
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>40.10.10</b> The admin will be able to see a list of all clickthroughs from a local URL.
    <li><b>40.10.20</b> The admin will be able to see a list of all clickthroughs to a foreign URL.
    <li><b>40.10.30</b> For each local-URL/foreign-URL pair, the admin will be shown a daily count
        of clickthroughs.
  </ul>
  <p>

  <li><b>40.20.0</b> Aggregated data (summary reports)
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>40.10.10</b> The admin will be able to see a list of all clickthroughs, grouped by local URL,
        along with a total count of clickthroughs for each URL pair.
    <li><b>40.10.20</b> The admin will be able to see a list of all clickthroughs, grouped by foreign URL,
        along with a total count of clickthroughs for each URL pair.
    <li><b>40.10.30</b> For each local-URL/foreign-URL pair, the admin will be shown a daily count
        of clickthroughs.
  </ul>
